\section*{Question 1}
\vspace{.25cm}
\noindent We are interested in knowing how the difference in campaign spending between incumbent and challenger affects the incumbent's vote share. 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Run a regression where the outcome variable is \texttt{voteshare} and the explanatory variable is \texttt{difflog}.	\vspace{.15cm}
		
	   \noindent  We can use the lm() function in R to see the regression between \texttt{voteshare} and \texttt{difflog}. Run the following codes in R then we can get the results of regression1.\\	\vspace{.15cm}
		
		\lstinputlisting[language=R,firstline=37,lastline=39,]{PS3.R}
		
		\noindent We can get the following results:\\ \vspace{.15cm}
		\begin{verbatim}
			Call:
			lm(formula = voteshare ~ difflog, data = inc.sub)
			
			Residuals:     
			   	Min      1Q      Median    3Q     Max 
			-0.26832 -0.05345 -0.00377  0.04780  0.32749 
			
			Coefficients:
			            Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    
		(Intercept) 0.579031   0.002251  257.19   <2e-16 ***
		difflog     0.041666   0.000968   43.04   <2e-16 ***
		---
		Signif. codes:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1
		
		Residual standard error: 0.07867 on 3191 degrees of freedom
		Multiple R-squared:  0.3673,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.3671 
		F-statistic:  1853 on 1 and 3191 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16
		\end{verbatim}
		\vspace{.5cm}
		
		\noindent From the results of regression1, we can see that the P-value (\textless 2.2e-16) is extremely low, providing strong evidence in favor of a significant relationship between \texttt{voteshare} and \texttt{difflog}\\ \vspace{.15cm}
		
		\item Make a scatterplot of the two variables and add the regression line. 	\vspace{.15cm}
		
		\noindent First, we draw the scatter plot of the two variables, and then using the abline() function to add the regression line. By running the following codes in R. We can get the graphic.\\

		\newpage
		\item Save the residuals of the model in a separate object.	\vspace{.17cm}
		
		\noindent Save the residuals of the regression1 in \texttt{residuals\textunderscore{}reg1} by running the following codes:\\
		
		\lstinputlisting[language=R,firstline=55,lastline=57]{PS3.R}
		
		\item Write the prediction equation.
		
		\noindent From the results of regression1 in Part 1.1, we can get the intercept and slope respectively. So the prediction equation would be:\\  
		\[ \hat{\texttt{voteshare}} = 0.579031 + 0.041666* \texttt{difflog} 
		\]\\ In this model, difflog has a positive effect on voteshare, with each unit difflog increase, increasing the voteshare estimate by 0.04167. The  voteshare estimate by 0.57903 when difflog is zero.\\

		\noindent  We can use the lm() function in R to see the regression between \texttt{voteshare} , \texttt{difflog} and \texttt{presvote}. Run the following codes in R then we can get the results of regression5.	\vspace{.15cm}

		\noindent From the results regression5 we can see that the P-value (\textless 2.2e-16) is extremely low, providing strong evidence in favor of a significant relationship between \texttt{voteshare} , \texttt{difflog} and \texttt{presvote}\\ \vspace{.15cm}
		
		\newpage
		\item Write the prediction equation.	\vspace{.15cm}
		
		\noindent \\From the results of regression5 in Part 5.1, we can get the intercept and slopes respectively. So the prediction equation would be:\\  \[ \hat{\texttt{voteshare}} = 0.4486442 + 0.0355431*\texttt{difflog} + 0.2568770*\texttt{presvote} \]  \\In this model, both difflog and presvote have positive effects on voteshare, the estimate value of voteshare would be 0.4486442 when difflog and presvote are zero. Controlling presvote unchanged, with each addional unit change of difflog, the estimate voteshare changes by 0.0355431. Controlling difflog unchanged, with one unit presvote  increase, increasing the voteshare estimate by 0.2568770.\\
		
		\item What is it in this output that is identical to the output in Question 4? Why do you think this is the case?\\
		
		\noindent From the regression results of regression5 and regression4, we can see that the Residuals of regression4 and regression5 are the same.\\
		\\The reason for this situation is that the model of regression4 is obtained by regressing residuals\textunderscore{}reg1 on residuals\textunderscore{}reg2, while the model of regression5 is obtained by directly regressing voteshare on difflog and presvote. Since residuals\textunderscore{}reg1 and residuals\textunderscore{}reg2 are respectively the residuals of voteshare on difflog and the residuals of presvote on difflog, the residuals,  in the regression results will be the same. This is also why we see these same values in both regression results.
